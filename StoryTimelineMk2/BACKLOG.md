## [BL-01] Tick label precision failure at large year values

**Status:** Fixed. `Math.round` applied in `buildFormatRegistry` (`timelineLayout.ts`). Broken step-snapping block reverted from `TimelineCanvas.vue`.

### Problem

At large absolute year values (observed from ~year 1,500 onwards), sub-year tick labels on the timeline grid show the wrong unit (e.g., "Day 187" where "Day 188" should appear, or duplicate day labels with adjacent days skipped).

The symptom worsens predictably with distance from year 0: near year 0 labels are always correct; near year 1,500,000 many are wrong.

### Root cause

The grid tick loop iterates using `i * stepFraction` where `i` is a global tick index spanning the entire timeline. For a 200-day calendar at year 1,500,000, `i ≈ 300,000,000`. Floating-point multiplication accumulates an error of ~±3×10⁻⁸ in the fractional part of the result.

When the formatter then does `Math.floor(fraction * yearLength)`, the day index is computed from a value like `186.9999...` instead of `187.000...`, giving the wrong day.

Near year 0 the tick indices are small (~187 for day 188), so the accumulated error is ~1×10⁻¹⁴ — well below the threshold to affect `Math.floor`. Hence no visible issues there.

### Why all other systems are unaffected

- **Items** — `AbsoluteStart = Year + Subtick * stepFraction` where `Subtick` is a small integer (≤ yearLength). No large-index accumulation.
- **Drag/pan** — single `getTimeFromX` computation, no accumulation.
- **Jump/wheel navigation** — sets `centerTime` directly or via a single `(index ± 1) * step` computation.
- **Distance points** — snap via `Math.round(time / step) * step`, tiny absolute error.
- **Cursor label** — same formatter but cursor already snaps to grid; the error is the same order and handled by Math.round in the snap itself.

### Proposed fix

Two targeted changes, nothing else:

1. In `buildFormatRegistry` (`timelineLayout.ts`), change `Math.floor(f * yearLength)` to `Math.round(f * yearLength)` in all sub-year formatters (DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS, SEASONS). `Math.round` absorbs the accumulated float error (always << ±0.5 of a day for any realistic year/calendar combination) and gives the correct unit label.

2. Ensure `targetStep` in `renderGrid` is always exactly `currentLod.stepFraction` — do not alter it. The entire coordinate system (`getXFromTime`, `absoluteToVisual`, `visualToAbsolute`) is built around a single consistent step value. Diverging `targetStep` from `step` sends ticks to visually wrong positions.

### Action required before fixing

A step-snapping block was added to `TimelineCanvas.vue` (around line 389) that changes `targetStep` and is actively making things worse ("all numbers are off"). **This must be reverted first.** The specific code to remove:

```typescript
{
    const cfg = store.calendarConfig;
    if (currentLod.formatKey === 'DAYS' && cfg.yearLength > 0) {
        const daysPerTick = Math.max(1, Math.round(targetStep * cfg.yearLength));
        targetStep = daysPerTick / cfg.yearLength;
    } else if (currentLod.formatKey === 'WEEKS' && ...) { ... }
}
```

## [BL-02] Subtick system redesign

**Status:** Design discussion, no implementation started.

### Background

Items currently store their timeline position as:

```
AbsoluteStart = Year + Subtick * LOD_StepFraction(CreationGranularity)
```

Where `Subtick` is an integer from 0 up to `round(1 / stepFraction) - 1`, representing which "slot" within the year the item was placed at the LOD level active during creation.

The previous application version stored `Subtick` as 0–9 (exactly 10 positions per year), and the import SQL uses `Year + Subtick / 10.0`. The current version extended this to allow more positions based on the LOD step, but the concept is the same.

### Problems with the current model

1. **Position is tied to the LOD profile, not to the calendar.** If you change the LOD step fractions, stored positions shift. If the calendar's step for DAYS was 1/365 at creation time and is later 1/200, the item is now at a different day.

2. **`Subtick` carries no calendar meaning.** It is an index into an evenly-spaced grid derived from the LOD step. You cannot read "Subtick 47" and know which month or day it is without knowing the step fraction at creation time.

3. **Import is approximate.** The legacy 0–9 Subtick is mapped to `Subtick / 10.0`, which is a fraction of a year with no connection to calendar months or days.

4. **Cross-calendar items have semantically undefined positions.** An item at `Subtick = 94` in a timeline using a 365-day LOD step represents day 94. In a 200-day calendar it would represent a different day — or not even a valid day if Subtick > yearLength.

### Proposed new model

Store position as direct calendar coordinates:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `Year` | int | Calendar year (unchanged) |
| `DayOfYear` | int | 0-indexed day within the year (0 to yearLength − 1) |

`AbsoluteStart` becomes a computed value: `Year + DayOfYear / yearLength`.

This has several benefits:
- Position has an unambiguous calendar meaning independent of any LOD profile
- `DayOfYear / yearLength` involves only small integers (DayOfYear < yearLength), so float precision is excellent at any year value
- The label for an item's date is trivially `Day (DayOfYear + 1)` without any floating-point lookup
- Future sub-day precision can be added as `TimeOfDay` without changing the model

**What granularity is stored?** The `CreationGranularity` (LOD index) stays as a metadata hint for display purposes (e.g., should this item's date show down to the day, month, or just the year?). But the stored position is always at the finest available granularity for that LOD level — DayOfYear for a DAYS creation, or `0` for a YEARS creation.

### Migration path from old Subtick

**Legacy import (Subtick 0–9):**
```
DayOfYear = round(Subtick * yearLength / 10)
```
Maps each of the 10 positions to the nearest calendar day.

**Current Subtick (0 to ~maxSubticks):**
```
DayOfYear = round(Subtick * yearLength * stepFraction)
           = round(Subtick * 1)          -- when step = 1/yearLength
           = Subtick                      -- exact, no conversion needed
```
When the creation LOD step was `1/yearLength` (i.e., one step per day), `Subtick` is already `DayOfYear`. For LODs with coarser steps (WEEKS, MONTHS), round to the nearest day.

### Open questions for design session

- Should changing the calendar's `yearLength` cause items with `DayOfYear > newYearLength` to be clamped, deleted, or warned about?
- Should `AbsoluteStart` remain a stored field (cached) or be computed every time from `(Year, DayOfYear)`?  Stored is faster but must be invalidated if calendar changes.
- For MONTHS or SEASONS granularity, should we store `MonthIndex + DayOfMonth` instead of just `DayOfYear`, or is `DayOfYear` always sufficient?
- How does the edit UI (`LodDateInput`) change? Currently it lets the user pick a subtick index; it should instead let them pick a calendar day (from a month/day picker or a day-of-year number).
